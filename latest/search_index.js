    "text": "So how do we highlight source code using the Highlights package?Firstly we import the package – assuming it has already been installed following the guidelines found in Installation.using HighlightsThis will make several names available to us for use:highlight colourises and formats strings;\nstylesheet prints out style definitions;\nlexers returns a lexer that matches a textual name;\nthe Themes module provides a selection of theme definitions;\nand the Lexers module provides a collection of lexer definitions.Next we need a String to highlight. For this example we will be using the code sample from The Julia Language website.source =\n    \"\"\"\n    function mandel(z)\n        c = z\n        maxiter = 80\n        for n = 1:maxiter\n            if abs(z) > 2\n                return n-1\n            end\n            z = z^2 + c\n        end\n        return maxiter\n    end\n\n    function randmatstat(t)\n        n = 5\n        v = zeros(t)\n        w = zeros(t)\n        for i = 1:t\n            a = randn(n,n)\n            b = randn(n,n)\n            c = randn(n,n)\n            d = randn(n,n)\n            P = [a b c d]\n            Q = [a b; c d]\n            v[i] = trace((P.'*P)^4)\n            w[i] = trace((Q.'*Q)^4)\n        end\n        std(v)/mean(v), std(w)/mean(w)\n    end\n    \"\"\"\nnothing # hideTo highlight source we pass it to highlight along with the output stream, the required output format, the lexer, and, optionally, the theme.open(\"source.html\", \"w\") do stream\n    highlight(stream, MIME(\"text/html\"), source, Lexers.JuliaLexer)\nendThis will print the highlighted version of source to source.html using the JuliaLexer definition and the DefaultTheme. We can also output LaTeX formatted text by using MIME(\"text/latex\") instead.Note though that at this point we have not included any style information needed to colourise and typeset the text that highlight has printed to the file. For that we need to call stylesheet first as follows:open(\"source.html\", \"w\") do stream\n    stylesheet(stream, MIME(\"text/html\"))\n    highlight(stream, MIME(\"text/html\"), source, Lexers.JuliaLexer)\nendThe highlighted version of source is available from here.stylesheet is passed most of the same information that highlight is aside from the source.note: Note\nThe above example will not produce a complete HTML page. No <html>, <head>, or <body> are printed. This is left to the user to decide what approach would suit their usecase best.Also note that if you would like to print the stylesheet to a .css file rather than to the same index.html then you may use:open(\"theme.css\", \"w\") do stream\n    stylesheet(stream, MIME(\"text/css\"))\nendThat's all there is to it. Have a look at the Theme Guide and Lexer Guide if you would like to define your own themes and lexers. Please consider contributing any that you write back to the package so that all users can benefit from them – no lexer or theme is too obscure to include in Highlights!"

    "text": "First, we import the necessary names from the Tokens and Lexers submodules.using Highlights.Tokens, Highlights.LexersTokens provides all the named tokens, such as COMMENT_SINGLE, while Lexers provides the AbstractLexer type and @lexer macro.Next we define a new type to represent our lexer.abstract CommentLexer <: AbstractLexernote: Note\nWe define the type and the definition separately so that we are able to reference one lexer from another definition without encountering UndefVarErrors.Finally we add a definition for our new lexer using the @lexer macro. We'll list the entire definition and then go over each part individually.@lexer CommentLexer Dict(\n    :name => \"Comments\",\n    :description => \"A C-style comment lexer.\",\n    :tokens => Dict(\n        :root => [\n            (r\"//.*\\n\", COMMENT_SINGLE),\n            (r\"/\\*\",    COMMENT_MULTILINE,   :multiline_comments),\n            (r\"[^/]+\",  TEXT)\n        ],\n        :multiline_comments => [\n            (r\"/\\*\",     COMMENT_MULTILINE,  :__push__),\n            (r\"\\*/\",     COMMENT_MULTILINE,  :__pop__),\n            (r\"[^/\\*]+\", COMMENT_MULTILINE),\n        ],\n    )\n)\nnothing # hideSo how does it work?The first line looks similar to the @theme macro usage in the previous section. The @lexer macro takes two arguments – the lexer name and it's definition Dict. The Dict contains all the rules used to tokenise source code that gets passed to the generated lexer.Several metadata fields should also be provided. :name provides a human-readable name for the lexer. :description provides some basic details about the lexer and what it is for.:tokens is a Dict of different states that the lexer steps through while trying to determine what to do with each character of a string. In this lexer we have two states – :root and :multiline_comments.note: Note\nThe lexer always starts in the :root state, so this is the only state that needs to be provided. You may find that some lexer definitions can be written with only a :root state, while others may need a significant number of different states to function correctly.Each state is a Vector of rules that are tested against sequentially until one matches the current position in the source code that we are trying to highlight. On a successful match we move the current position forward and start again at the first rule of the current state.In the :root state of our CommentLexer we begin with(r\"//.*\\n\", COMMENT_SINGLE)which tests whether the current position in our source code matches the given regular expression r\"//.*\", i.e. a single line comment such as// This is a singleline comment.If it matches then we create a new COMMENT_SINGLE token that spans the entire match – from / to . in the above example.When the rule does not match we then move onto the next one:(\"r/\\*\", COMMENT_MULTILINE, :multiline_comments)which tries to match against a string starting with /*, i.e. the start of a multiline comment such as/*\n   A\n   multiline\n   comment.\n */When this rule is successfully matched, like in the previous example, we create a new COMMENT_MULTILINE token and move passed the match. Instead of going back to the start of the current state though, we first enter a new state called :multiline_comments. Once that state returns we then jump back to the first rule of the :root state.The last rule of the :root state isn't all that interesting:(r\"[^/]+\", TEXT)This just matches any non-comment characters and assigns them to a TEXT token.Now lets look at the :multiline_comments state.(r\"/\\*\", COMMENT_MULTILINE, :__push__),When the above rule matches (i.e. the start of a multiline comment) then we enter a special state called :__push__. What :__push__ does is just call the current state again, so internally we push a new function call onto the call stack.A similar naming scheme is used for the :__pop__ state, where we return from the current state and so pop the current function call off the call stack:(r\"\\*/\", COMMENT_MULTILINE, :__pop__),And the last rule, similar to the TEXT rule in :root, just matches all non multiline comment characters and assigns the result to a COMMENT_MULTILINE token:(r\"[^/\\*]+\", COMMENT_MULTILINE),note: Note\nAll the tokens in :multiline_comments are assigned to COMMENT_MULTILINE. This is because when we are inside a nested comment everything will be a multiline comment.That's all there is to writing a basic lexer. There are a couple of other rule types that can be used to make more complex lexers, which are described at the end of this section of the manual. First, though, we'll highlight some text using this new lexer to see whether it works correctly.using Highlights # Imports `stylesheet` and `highlight`.\n\nsource =\n    \"\"\"\n    // A single line comment.\n\n    This is not a comment.\n\n    /*\n       And a multiline one\n       /* with a nested comment */\n       inside.\n     */\n\n    This isn't a comment either.\n\n    // And another single line // comment.\n    \"\"\"\n\nopen(\"comments-lexer.html\", \"w\") do stream\n    stylesheet(stream, MIME(\"text/html\"))\n    highlight(stream, MIME(\"text/html\"), source, CommentLexer)\nendThe resulting highlighted text can be see here."
